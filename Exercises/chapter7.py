#1 Give a sequence of "compare exchange" operations for sorting four records 

#Bubble sort 
# 31 25 33 -1
# 25 31 33 -1
# 25 31 33 -1
# 25 31 -1 33
# 25 31 -1 33
# 25 -1 31 33
# -1 25 31 33

#2 Which of the 3 elementary methods (selection sort, insertion sort, or bubble sort) runs fastest for an already sorted file?
# Insertion sort, because each element is determined to be in the right place and requires no further comparison
