#starting chapter 5

#1 Suppose it is known that the running time of one algorithm is O(N log N) and that the running time of another algorithm is O(N^3). What does
#this say about the relative performance of the algorithms?

'''
As the value of n increases, N^3 will increase at a much faster rate than O(N log N), meaning that O(N log N) is a more efficient algorithm
'''

#2 Suppose it is known that the running time of one algorithm is always about N log N and that the running time of another algorithm is O(N^3). What does
# this say about the relative performance of the algorithms?
'''
It is difficult to predict which algorithm will be the most efficient, as o(N^3) is a worst case scenario, while N(log N) is an average run time. However,
I would still assume that N(log N) executes faster, as N^3 is significantly more costly in terms of time

# 4 Explain the difference between O(1) and O(2)
'''
O(2) takes double the amount of time as O(1) in a worst case scenario. However, for both notations, the performance of the algorithm doesn't depend
on the size of the input
