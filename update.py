'''
So far, I am on chapter 3 of this workbook. I feel like progress has been a little slow. 
I am struggling on understanding some parts of the book, and I try to fixate on it until I can understand it. 
When it comes to the chapter exercises, sometimes I can't understand exactly what the question is asking, such as the "movenexttofront" algorithm
in chapter 2. Overall, I'm hoping to pick up the pace a little bit, and I think this will happen if I use external resources when I get confused, 
and try to aim for finishing ~ 2 chapters every 3 weeks.
